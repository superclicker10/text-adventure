This is a text adventure designed for solo python use.
This is my first big big project doing python (not really that far into learning yet) so is relatively basic on the scale of things.
Have fun using it! Assuming I set the permissions correctly.
***RUN MAINSCRIPT.PY TO START***

Also - have python. You can't launch it otherwise.

If there are any bugs, please submit to the issues part of the github you got this from.
