Welcome to my game!

To play open mainscript.py.

If the game closes suddenly a bug has appeared.
If this does occur, please use the "issues" tab on github to alert this to me.

NOTE: STOP YOUR GAME IMMEDIATELY AND REPLAY TO CALIBRATE SAVING (if you want saving)
ALTERNATIVE FIX: DRAG SAVE FROM DOWNLOADS TO THE FOLDER WITH PYTHON SCRIPTS

Also - have python. You can't launch it otherwise.

Have fun!
