Welcome to my game!

To play open mainscript.py.

If the game closes suddenly a bug has appeared.
If this does occur, please use the "issues" tab on github to alert this to me.
If you get stuck, that's most likely you, not the game.

NOTE: STOP YOUR GAME IMMEDIATELY AND REPLAY TO CALIBRATE SAVING (if you want saving)

Have fun!
