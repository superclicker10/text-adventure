Welcome to my game!

To play open mainscript.py.

If the game closes suddenly a bug has appeared.
If this does occur, please use the "issues" tab on github to alert this to me.
If you get stuck, that's most likely you, not the game.

NOTE: STOP YOUR GAME IMMEDIATELY AND REPLAY TO CALIBRATE SAVING (if you want saving)
ALTERNATIVE FIX: DRAG SAVE FROM DOWNLOADS TO THE FOLDER WITH PYTHON SCRIPTS

Also - have python. You can't launch it otherwise.

Have fun!
